# STEMM Academy Workshop 2017

An introduction to the internet of things and making a [Particle](http://particle.io) Powered Ambient Weather Orb.

As part of this workshop you'll have a kit with

- A breadboard
- A Particle Photon
- A Micro USB Cable (use this to power the photon)
- A 10K Potentiometer a.k.a. a dial
- 10K and 1K Ohm Resistors
- LEDs (components that make light)
- A momemntary push button

By the end of this workshop you'll have built a simple ambient weather visualization using this components. It'll work like this:
- the pushbutton will let you turn the visualization on (displaying) and off (no lights).
- the potentiometer will work like a dial allowing you to select multiple cities 
- in the background, the microcontroller will look up weather data online 
- while it's retrieving data, the LED will blink to let you know
- it'll display temperature information on the device using the inbuilt RGB (full color) LED.
- hot places will be displayed with with a red color (>95F or more) and cool blue will indicate temperatures of 50F or less.
- it'll automatically update every 10 minutes.
